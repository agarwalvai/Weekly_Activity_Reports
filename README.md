<br>->[Week3](Week3.md)
<br>->[Week4](Week4.md)

2. What I gained from the internship-<br>
<br>->Relevant technical knowledge pertaining to pragmatic solutions desired in industry today.
<br>->Valuable experience transitioning into work environment.
<br>->Ability to demonstrate a balance of teamwork and independence by establishing interactive and assisted remote learning environments.
