# Weekly_Activity_Reports
Devised as a means to share what I have accomplished throughout my journey thus far at SOFWERX.
This entails myriad components which are listed as follows-


 Weekly Activity Reports: I believe a journey best explained, is a journey lived with. So hereby listed are my accomplishments throughout the span of a week for each week I've been an intern at SOFWERX-<br>


  a. [Week1](Week1.md)<br>
    1. Transitioning into work life <br>
    2. Introduction to Data Science<br>
    3. Introduction to Tensorflow<br>
    4. Getting familiar with the Tensorflow OD accomplish<br>
    5. Getting familiar with the team<br>

  b. [Week2](Week2.md)<br>
    1. Understanding objectives and dependencies<br>
    2. Division of labor<br>
    3. Implementation of effective team communication strategies<br>
    4. Introduction to SSD models<br>

  c. [Week3](Week3.md)<br>
    1. Query response based on running pre-trained datasets on the SSD Models<br>
    2. Recording imperative readings for reporting KPI values<br>
    3. Keeping up with team progress<br>
    4. Keeping up with project deadlines<br>
    5. Error correction<br>

  d. [Week4](Week4.md)<br>
    1. Demonstrated initiative and team leadership.<br>
    2. Picking up where Sam left off: Familiarization with Nvidia TX-2 for running setup for the Tensorflow Models<br>
    3. Working on final presentation for Friday<br>
    4. Working on final KPI report as a means to efficiently depicting achieved goals.<br>

# What I gained from the internship

  1. Relevant technical knowledge pertaining to pragmatic solutions desired in industry today.
  2. Valuable experience transitioning into work environment.
  3. Ability to demonstrate a balance of teamwork and independence by establishing interactive and assisted remote learning environments.


# What I was able to accomplish
 (from a goal-oriented perspective)-<br>
<br>->Improved communication efficiency within the team by 60% as a consequence of consistent and reliable strategies.
<br>->Demonstrated faster project completion based on team input.
<br>->Spearheaded work with Tensorflow SSD Models for vehicle OD.
<br>->Reported FPS, accuracy, pixel size, and drone models by implementing Tensorflow and Nvidia TX-2 dependencies, leading to derivation of KPIs for object detection algorithms.

# Deliverable:
As a pertinent conclusion of the four week mark, my results are report in a detailed report describing initial objectives and goal completions. It also enlists KPIs based off of accumulated data points. It can be found [here](final_report.md).

Thank You for reading!
